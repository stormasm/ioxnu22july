//! An implementation of the "consumer-end" of the sequencer - pulling messages
//! from the sequencer, decoding the [`DmlOperation`] within and applying them
//! to in-memory state.
//!
//! A [`SequencedStreamHandler`] is responsible for consuming messages from the
//! sequencer (through the [`WriteBufferReading`] interface), decoding them to
//! [`DmlOperation`] instances and pushing them to the [`DmlSink`] for further
//! processing and buffering.
//!
//! The ingest/reads performed by the [`SequencedStreamHandler`] are rate
//! limited by the [`LifecycleManager`] it is initialised by, pausing until
//! [`LifecycleHandle::can_resume_ingest()`] returns true.
