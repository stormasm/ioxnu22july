-- query data
SELECT * from cpu;

SELECT min(region) from cpu;

-- projection
-- expect that to get a subset of the columns and in the order specified
SELECT user, region from cpu;

-- predicate on CPU
SELECT * from cpu where time > to_timestamp('1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000120+00:00');

-- projection and predicate
-- expect that to get a subset of the columns and in the order specified
SELECT user, region from cpu where time > to_timestamp('1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000120+00:00');

-- basic grouping
SELECT count(*) from cpu group by region;


-- select from a different measurement
SELECT * from disk;
